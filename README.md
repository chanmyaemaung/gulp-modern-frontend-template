# GULP: The Production Ready Modern FrontEnd Template

This is a production-ready project built with Gulp. The project comes pre-configured with tasks that compile Sass to CSS, Less to CSS, minify JS, optimize images, and minify HTML.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this project, you must have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- Gulp CLI (you can install it by running `npm install -g gulp-cli`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Usage

To use this project, open the terminal in the project directory and run the command:

These tasks include:

- `sassTask`: Compiles Sass to CSS
- `lessTask`: Compiles Less to CSS
- `jsTask`: Minifies JS and transpiles with Babel
- `imageTask`: Optimizes images
- `htmlMinify`: Minifies HTML

To run an individual task, open the terminal in the project directory and run the command:

`npm run dev`

This will start the default npm task, which will compile all of the source files and start a BrowserSync server that will automatically reload the browser when changes are made. After each task successfully finishes, the generated files will be placed in the `dist` folder. This is where developers can find the compiled and optimized project files that are ready for deployment.
